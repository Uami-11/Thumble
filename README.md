# Thumble
This is my C project, I have made a text-based RPG. I have aptly named it Thumble.
As characters in this story tumble into the main setting. And it relates to thumbs in some way...

Features:
- choices made from numbered inputs
- the most rudimentary battle system imaginable
- find three magic orbs
- thumbs??

You could finish this game in about 10 minutes. For the best experience, I'd say to talk to the characters as much as possible.
The game is not really focused on the battles, but more so interactions. I tried to be really funny

Was rushed at the end, will expand a bit more

RUN THE THUMBLE.EXE FILE TO PLAY! ENJOY
